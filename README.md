# Getting Started with Create React App

## Setup
### Code Editor
Please install the `eslint` plugin. This will warn you when your codestyle is incorrect.
Optionally, you can install `prettier`. This plugin will format your code automatically based on the eslint rules.

## Starting the project
First run `npm install` in the root directory of the project. This ensures you have all the necessary npm packages to get started.

Running `npm start` will start the project on your localhost. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
